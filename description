# Cyclistic Bike-Share Capstone Project  
**Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**
Juan Carlos Diego Angulo

This repository contains my completed **Capstone Project** for the Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera.  

**Case Study**: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?  
**Company**: Cyclistic (fictional name for Chicago's Divvy bike-share)  
**Business Task**: Understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, to inform marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.  

**Dataset**: Public Divvy trip data from Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 (~700,000 trips after cleaning).  
**Tools Used**: R (tidyverse, lubridate) for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  

## Key Improvements Over Spreadsheet Analysis
- **Reproducible & Scalable**: Full R script automates cleaning and handles multiple quarters consistently.
- **Better Data Quality**: Removes invalid rides (<1 min or >24 hours), adds useful variables (hour, month, day name).
- **Deeper Insights**: Rich aggregations by day, hour, and year.

## Major Findings
1. **Ride Volume**  
   Annual members make the majority of trips (65–80% depending on quarter), but casual riders surged in early 2020.

2. **Ride Duration**  
   Casual riders take much longer rides:  
   - Casual: ~35–45 minutes average  
   - Members: ~12–15 minutes  

3. **Day of Week Patterns**  
   - Members: Peak on weekdays → commuting behavior  
   - Casual: Peak on weekends → leisure/recreation

4. **Time of Day Patterns**  
   - Members: Clear rush-hour peaks (7–9 AM & 4–6 PM)  
   - Casual: Broad afternoon/evening peak

## Conclusion
Annual members use Cyclistic for **routine, short commutes** on weekdays.  
Casual riders use it **occasionally for longer, leisure-oriented rides** on weekends.  

These differences highlight opportunities to market membership benefits (cost savings, unlimited rides) specifically to casual riders who already take longer trips.

## Top 3 Recommendations
1. **"Weekend Rider" Campaign**  
   Target casual users with promotions emphasizing savings on longer weekend rides.

2. **"Unlimited Convenience" Messaging**  
   Highlight break-even cost calculators for frequent or long-ride users.

3. **Seasonal Trial Offers**  
   Provide discounts or trials to casual riders during high-usage periods.
